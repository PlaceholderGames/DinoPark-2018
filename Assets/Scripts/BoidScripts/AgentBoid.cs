// Perhaps my favourite name of a file ever. I think I'll call each bird that.
// Agent Boid.
// The purpose of this script is to be attached to an agent prefab.
// BoidController.cs will spawn these prefabs and this script will
// set rules and behaviour. Hopefully some fun emergent behaviour
// appears as a result.
// There are three primary tenants to a boid algorithm:
// Separation // Alignment // Cohesion //
// Hopefully these can be summarized in one function each
// and unleashed in the Update function, free for Agent Boid
// to go where he or she pleases.
